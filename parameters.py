Msun = 2E30 # Mass of our sun - 2E30 is good
Rsun = 3E8 # Radius of our sun
L = 2e10 # Initial size of the universe
dist0 = 0.4 # Initial distribution of the stars. Bigger is denser in the center of the initial universe - 0.4 is fairly even
h0 = 2e-5 # 1.0e-5 # Hubble's constant - expansion rate 8.0e-6 is good.
